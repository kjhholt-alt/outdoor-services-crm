The goal of this project is to create a modern CRM system like Salesforce, I want a site that I can preview before going live with the below features. Main features of the site are a login for John Lischer and make sure to save all changes to github and create a .MD file, also an excel file is saved in our project folder named customer list by region CRM, this will be our data set for the CRM
I want you to study what other CRM systems have like salesforce and implement them into our project, our main features we want to use are having a place to browse our entries with business name, phone number, address, and contact name, fleet description
and custom notes section with a history function so i can update notes and see what previous notes for customers are, i want to log my meeting and set a reminder after calls to call them back in 30 days, i want ability to add new business and contacts and sort by regions etc
I want to look at companies listed and provide routing for my day to know where i should go for the day based on a string of business that are near each other and have that mapped out for me, i want this site to be very functional on ipad and iphones as well , i want a toggle for dark theme as well thats a dark and easy on the eyes, i want a running call history log i can reference back to and an email i can set to send on Friday at 4pm centeral standard time that gives me a review of upciming week of calls that need to be made and reminders etc.
