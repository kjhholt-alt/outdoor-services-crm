## What You're Getting

A fully custom, production-deployed Customer Relationship Management system built specifically for outdoor service businesses (lawn care, landscaping, irrigation, snow removal, etc.).

This is not a template or a WordPress plugin. This is a custom-built application tailored to how your business actually works.

### Core Features Included

- **Customer Management** — Search, filter, sort, and track all your customers in one place
- **Job Scheduling & Tracking** — Create jobs, assign to dates, track status from estimate to completion
- **Estimates & Invoices** — Generate professional estimates and PDF invoices with your branding, line items, and tax calculation
- **Service Catalog** — 24 pre-loaded services across 5 categories (lawn care, landscaping, irrigation, hardscaping, seasonal), fully customizable
- **Calendar View** — Month/week/day views with color-coded jobs by service type
- **Crew Mobile App** — Simplified mobile-first view for field workers with large touch targets, map links, and job details
- **Photo Documentation** — Before/after photo capture with GPS location stamps, stored offline so it works without cell service
- **Weather Integration** — 7-day forecast on your dashboard so you can plan around rain days
- **Reports & Analytics** — Revenue trends, jobs by status, revenue by category, seasonal trends, crew productivity charts
- **Route Planning** — Optimizes your daily drive route across customer locations
- **Follow-up Reminders** — Automatic 30-day follow-up reminders with snooze and complete
- **Activity Logging** — Track calls, emails, texts, meetings, cold calls, and card drops per customer
- **Data Import/Export** — Import customers from Excel/CSV, export anytime
- **Dark Mode** — Full dark theme support
- **Works on Any Device** — Desktop, tablet, phone (iPad optimized)

### Tech Details (for transparency)

- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript, hosted on Vercel (fast, reliable, scales automatically)
- Backend: Django 5 + PostgreSQL database, hosted on Railway (secure, auto-backups)
- Both are live and deployed right now

**Includes everything in Option A, plus:**

### Option C: "Turnkey + Ongoing Support" — $800 setup + $75-150/month

Everything in Option B, plus I keep it running and keep improving it.

**Includes everything in Option B, plus monthly support:**

**Examples of features I could build over time:**
- Automated text/email reminders to customers before appointments
- Online payment integration (Stripe — customers pay invoices online)
- Customer portal (customers log in to see their service history and upcoming jobs)
- QuickBooks or accounting software sync
- Automated recurring job scheduling (e.g., "mow every 2 weeks April-October")
- Team time tracking and payroll hours export
- Marketing email campaigns to past customers
- Review request automation (auto-ask for Google reviews after completed jobs)

**Best for:** Business owners who want a technology partner, not just a one-time project. This is the best value long-term — you get a system that grows with your business.

## Hosting Costs (Paid by You)

These are the services that keep the app running. I don't mark these up — you pay the providers directly.

| Service | Cost | What It Does |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Vercel (frontend hosting) | Free | Hosts the website/app interface |
| Railway (backend + database) | ~$5-20/mo | Runs the server and stores your data |
| Domain name | ~$10-15/yr | Your custom web address (e.g., aatoscrm.com) |
| Weather API (optional) | Free | Live weather forecasts on dashboard |
| **Total monthly** | **~$5-20/mo** | |

## Why This Price?

A custom CRM like this from a software agency would cost $10,000-$30,000+. I'm not an agency — I'm a developer building my portfolio and my business. I price fairly because:

1. I built this using modern AI-assisted development tools, which let me move fast
2. I want long-term relationships with clients, not one-time cash grabs
3. Your success is my portfolio piece and my reference
4. If you choose Option C, the monthly support is where I earn your trust over time
